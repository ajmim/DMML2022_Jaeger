# Instructions - Data Mining and Machine Learning - Project

## Detecting Difficulty Level of French Texts

### Step by step guidelines

The following are a set of step by step guidelines to help you get started with your project for the Data Mining and Machine Learning class.
To test what you learned in the class, we will hold a competition. You will create a classifier that predicts how the level of some text in French (A1,..., C2). The team with the highest rank will get some goodies in the last class (some souvenirs from tech companies: Amazon, LinkedIn, etc).

**2 people per team**

Choose a team here:
https://moodle.unil.ch/mod/choicegroup/view.php?id=1305831


#### 1. ðŸ“‚ Create a public GitHub repository for your team using this naming convention `DMML2022_[your_team_name]` with the following structure:
- data (folder)
- code (folder)
- documentation (folder)
- a readme file (.md): *mention team name, participants, brief description of the project, approach, summary of results table and link to the explainatory video (see below).*

All team members should contribute to the GitHub repository.

#### 2. ðŸ‡° Join the competititon on Kaggle using the invitation link we sent on Slack.

Under the Team tab, save your team name (`UNIL_your_team_name`) and make sure your team members join in as well. You can merge your user account with your teammates in order to create a team.

#### 3. ðŸ““ Read the data into your colab notebook. There should be one code notebook per team, but all team members can participate and contribute code.

You can use either direct the Kaggle API and your Kaggle credentials (as explained below and **entirely optional**), or dowload the data form Kaggle and upload it onto your team's GitHub repository under the data subfolder.

#### 4. ðŸ’Ž Train your models and upload the code under your team's GitHub repo. Set the `random_state=0`.
- baseline
- logistic regression with TFidf vectoriser (simple, no data cleaning)
- KNN & hyperparameter optimisation (simple, no data cleaning)
- Decision Tree classifier & hyperparameter optimisation (simple, no data cleaning)
- Random Forests classifier (simple, no data cleaning)
- another technique or combination of techniques of your choice

BE CREATIVE! You can use whatever method you want, in order to climb the leaderboard. The only rule is that it must be your own work. Given that, you can use all the online resources you want.

#### 5. ðŸŽ¥ Create a YouTube video (10-15 minutes) of your solution and embed it in your notebook. Explain the algorithms used and the evaluation of your solutions. *Select* projects will also be presented live by the group during the last class.


### Submission details (one per team)

1. Download a ZIPped file of your team's repository and submit it in Moodle here. IMPORTANT: in the comment of the submission, insert a link to the repository on Github.

### Grading (one per team)
- 20% Kaggle Rank
- 50% code quality (using classes, splitting into proper files, documentation, etc)
- 15% github quality (include link to video, table with progress over time, organization of code, images, etc)
- 15% video quality (good sound, good slides, interesting presentation).
